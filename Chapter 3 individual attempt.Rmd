## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
read.csv(file = "create_alc")
if doesnt work
read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/alc.txt", sep ",", col = TRUE)

```

Choose 4 interesting y's with hypotheses.
hypothesis1: lower grades are linked with higher alcohol consumption
hypothesis2: men drink more than women
hypothesis 3: students that are absent drink more. maybe out of analysis atm
hypothesis 4: higher internet use is linked with higher alcohol use


h1 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x=high_use, y = G3))
h2 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x=high_use, y = sex))
h3 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x=high_use, y = Pstatus))
h4 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x=high_use, y = internet))

h1 + geom_boxplot() + ylab("grade")
h2 + geom_boxplot() + ylab("sex")
h3 + geom_boxplot() + ylab("absence")
h4 + geom_boxplot() + ylab("internet")

log_model <- glm(high_use ~ grade + sex + absence + internet, data = alc, family = "binomial")
summary("log_model")
coef("log_model")


OR <- coef(log_model) %>% exp
CI <- confint("log_model")
cbind(OR, CI)
